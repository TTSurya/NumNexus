I created this mini-project to test my basic understanding of Java. Itâ€™s nothing fancy
like OOP, just a simple program.
This was actually one of the first programs I ever wrote in Java. The game itself is
one I used to play with my local and school friends. I always wanted to implement it
in a programming language, and this was the perfect opportunity to do so.
I don't know if such a game already exists in the wide Internet.
