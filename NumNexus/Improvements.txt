The game's implementation can always be improved by making use of better Data Structures and combining 
all validity functions into just one since there's a lot of code just being repeated causing extra resources.
The current code has sufficient readability.

Currently, the user has infinite turns to guess the number. The game could always be made more interactive
by including "scores"/"lives". Additionally, we could enhance the game by creating a "GUI"(Graphical User Interface).
