Most of the code is self documented and the logic is basic and clear. I'll just explain my thought process
for a quick understanding of the code.

1) I wanted to define functions without the use of objects/classes but wasn't sure how to implement that.
So, I created a class called "methods" which had no members but only methods.
2) Next, I created a "validity" class that has a single member from the class "methods" to make use of the
functions I previously defined. The purpose of this class is to define methods that check the validity of a number.
(Refer rules.txt to understand what I mean by a "valid" number).
3) Finally, it was time for the big picture, putting all together in the "NumNexus" class and create a functional game.
